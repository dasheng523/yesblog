# Progress

## What works
- Successfully used the `haskell-hackage-mcp` tool to retrieve API documentation for Haskell packages (e.g., `rel8`).
- Demonstrated ability to understand and apply tool parameters, including correcting usage errors (e.g., `plan_mode_respond` parameter formatting).

## What's left to build
- N/A for this specific task.

## Current status
- Confirmed smooth operation of Hackage documentation retrieval.
- Documenting lessons learned for future reference.

## Known issues
- Initial incorrect usage of `plan_mode_respond` due to parameter formatting misunderstanding. This was corrected.

## Evolution of project decisions
- Decision to explicitly document tool usage experiences and best practices in Memory Bank files to improve future performance and ensure knowledge retention across sessions.
