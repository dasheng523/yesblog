# Progress

## What works
- Successfully read Beam documentation tutorials.
- Wrote Beam Schema and example code in `src/BeamExample.hs`.
- Successfully modified `app/Main.hs` to call the Beam example.
- Successfully updated `yesblog.cabal` to include Beam dependencies and expose the `BeamExample` module.
- Resolved compilation issues for the `BeamExample` module, including `hidden module` and `deriving strategy` problems.

## What's left to build
- None. The Beam example has been successfully integrated and compiled.

## Current status
- The Beam example has been successfully integrated into the project and compiles.

## Known issues
- Initial attempts to use `beam-migrate` led to compilation errors; migration functionality was temporarily abandoned as per user instructions.
- Warnings due to missing explicit deriving strategies (`stock`, `anyclass`) when deriving instances.
- `Show` and `Eq` instances for `PrimaryKey` require the `UndecidableInstances` extension and precise context constraints.
